          "Brilliantly dissecting the mind-opening potential and dire existential threat that technology simultaneously represents, Janak Alford delivers a critical and thought-provoking thesis on the future with Intelligent Digital Ecosystems. Both philosophically rich and linguistically sharp, the author immediately establishes himself as authoritative, combining academic clarity with elements of lyrical and dramatic writing. The metaphors are accessible, the artistic elements are stunning, and the ideas are intuitively ordered throughout, in this visionary, timely, and essential primer for the future." <br/><br/>
